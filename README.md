Expense Tracker
Overview
The Expense Tracker is a Java-based console application that helps you manage and track your daily expenses. It allows you to add, view, delete expenses, and also get summaries based on categories or date ranges.

Features
Add New Expense
Users can add new expense records including a description, amount, category, and date.

View All Expenses
Display all expenses stored in the file.

Delete an Expense
Remove a specific expense from the list using its serial number.

Show Summary by Category
View the total amount spent on a specific category of expenses.

Show Total Expenses for a Date Range
Calculate and display the total amount spent on expenses within a specified date range.

File Structure
All expenses are saved in a file named expense.txt in the following format:
Serial No: X, Description: [description], Amount: [amount], Category: [category], Date: [yyyy-mm-dd]

How to Use
1. Add New Expense
This option allows you to add new expenses by entering the following details:

Description: A brief description of the expense.
Amount: The monetary amount of the expense.
Category: The category of the expense (e.g., food, transport, etc.).
Date: The date of the expense in YYYY-MM-DD format.
2. View All Expenses
This option will print out all the expenses stored in the expense.txt file, each with a unique serial number.

3. Delete an Expense
This option allows you to delete an expense by entering the serial number associated with it. The file will be updated accordingly.

4. Show Summary by Category
This option will ask you for a category and then display the total amount spent in that category by summing all relevant expenses.

5. Show Total Expenses for a Date Range
This option allows you to enter a start date and an end date, and it will display the total amount spent on all expenses within that date range.

Installation
1.) Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git

2.) Navigate to the project directory:
cd expense-tracker

3.) Compile the Java files:
javac expense.java

4.) Run the application:
java expense

How It Works
The application interacts with the expense.txt file for all operations. Each time a user adds, views, deletes, or summarizes expenses, the application reads from or writes to this file.

Data Parsing
Expenses are stored in a comma-separated format in the expense.txt file, and the application uses this format to read and extract information when performing operations such as viewing, deleting, or summarizing expenses.

Error Handling
The program handles the following errors:

FileNotFoundException: If the file doesn't exist, it will notify the user.
Invalid Input: If invalid data (e.g., non-numeric values for amounts or improperly formatted dates) is entered, the program will display an error message.
